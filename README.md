Counting (maximal) antichains in the lattice of set partitions

This is a supporing file for OEIS on computation of (maximal) antichains in the lattice of set partitions.

## Outline

### 0. The basic code with the class for managing generation of formal concepts via NextClosure algorithm

### 1. Loading formal contexts for antichains and maximal antichains of a partition lattice

### 2. Counting of maximal antichains for n in {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} 

### 3. Counting of  antichains for n in {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  (https://oeis.org/A302250)

#### Comment to Sections 2 and 3.


We start with n=0 (i.e., with the set partition of zero elements), but in OEIS the offset is 1, i.e. there the sequences start with n=1.
